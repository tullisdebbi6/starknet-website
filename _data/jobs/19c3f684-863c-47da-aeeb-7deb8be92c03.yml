  title: Mechanism Designer
  description: "An ideal candidate has a strong understanding of algorithmic game
    theory, in understanding it, in applying it, and in using it to prove the
    game-theoretic robustness of protocols. In other words, the ideal candidate
    has a track record in mechanism design. Beyond game theoretic fundamentals,
    an appreciation for how game theoretic assumptions change in the asynchrony
    and irrationality of distributed systems is highly preferable. While a basic
    understanding of L1 and L2 designs, systemic risks, and consensus algorithms
    is required, a strong understanding is preferred. You should be able to work
    in a distributed research team, express their research ideas clearly, and
    know how to argue their findings formally. We appreciate candidates who are
    not afraid of voicing their opinions and motivate them or ask for
    explanations of concepts they are not familiar with. Responsibilities: As a
    mechanism designer, you will participate in research on, for example:
    Transaction fee mechanisms. Prover coordination and sequencer design,
    decentralization, incentivization. Auctioning block-building rights. Levels
    of finality, and risks associated with each. Staking: vanilla staking,
    restaking, liquid staking, and systemic risks they come with. L2 governance,
    PoS vs PoG, etc. Skills: An algorithmic game theory track record, including
    a strong preference for published work in the field. Ability to identify
    mechanism design problems and propose solutions. An understanding of
    distributed protocol design. Particularly, a demonstrable ability to
    identify the trade-offs faced by protocols when deployed on blockchains.
    Familiarity with Ethereum: how it works and why? Familiarity with designs of
    L2s. Ability to express thoughts precisely."

      Today, the Starknet Foundation is excited to announce the launch of our
      [Seed Grant Program](https://www.starknet.io/en/ecosystem/grant).  


      Designed to provide teams with grants of up to $25,000 USDC, the Seed Grant Program will accelerate and usher in a new wave of cutting-edge dApps, infrastructure, and tooling products across all categories in Web3.


      ## Who can qualify? 


      The Seed Grant Program aims to support early stage teams with non-dilutive funding to support their go-to-market efforts.


      This new program is intended for projects that have already developed a minimum viable product (MVP) or proof of concept, but haven’t yet gone to market and acquired a core group of users yet. 


      Consider applying for a Seed Grant if you or your project satisfy the following criteria: 


      * actively involved in the Starknet community and / or participated in a Starknet hackathon, builder program, or other entry-level initiative;

      * developed an MVP or proof of concept; and

      * planning on using or building upon existing Starknet tools and integrations.


      ## Grant Amounts


      The Seed Grant Program will allocate eligible teams with grants of up to $25,000 USDC for a period of three months. 


      ## Application Process


      1. **Application** – apply via our [grant submission form](https://tinyurl.com/snf-seed-grants) to submit your project.  

      2. **Internal Evaluation** – an internal committee will assess each application based on potential impact, innovation, milestones, community engagement & track record, and embeddedness with the Starknet ecosystem.

      3. **Results** – results will be communicated to applicants within two weeks.

      4. **Onboarding** – successful applicants (Grantees) will need to complete KYC and sign a grant agreement before receiving funding.

      5. **Post Grant Check-in** – after three months, the Foundation will check-in with Grantees and assess the results. The Grantees should share regular updates (blog posts, videos, AMAs etc) with the team to assist in this process.


      ## Who is Not Eligible


      This program is not for mature stage projects.  If your product has been live on mainnet for over three months and/or has a core group of users already, it will not be eligible for a Seed Grant. 


      We do not accept applications related to:


      * Gambling

      * Drugs

      * Firearms

      * Illicit trade

      * Money laundering

      * Any criminal activity


      ## About Starknet 


      Starknet is a decentralised layer two building on top of the Ethereum network.  From the beginning, Starknet has led innovation with the invention and application of ZK-STARKs as the first validity-proofs to settle on Ethereum. As we continue forward, we believe Starknet will be the first to reach the high transaction rates necessary for a global scale without sacrificing the blockchain first principles lost in the pursuit of scalability.

      * **Starknet users/ECMP/developers:** Your Starknet wallet is installed and set up in your browser.

      * **StarkEx-powered app users:** You have the credentials for connecting to your account for the StarkEx-powered app.

      * **Ethereum stakers/Protocol Guild members**: Your Ethereum wallet is installed and set up.

      * **Ethereum developers, GitHub developers other than Ethereum developers, and EIP authors**: You have your GitHub credentials.

      * Please note that due to regulatory constraints, Provisions and STRK will not be available to:

        * Any person or entity in Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other applicable sanctioned country, or any person or entity on the Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

         If you’re eligible because you are a Starknet user or ECMP recipient, make sure that you connect with a Starknet address that is eligible to receive STRK, and make sure that your wallet is updated to the latest version.

           **IMPORTANT:** If you get an error message that your wallet is not up to date, make sure that your browser is up to date. You might need to restart it.On Google Chrome, you can check if there are pending updates by opening the browser menu going to **Help > About Google Chrome**.

      ## **Continuing with the claim process**


      1. Proceed by clicking the **See your allocation** button.

         ![](/assets/5.1_button_see_your_allocation.png)

         A screen appears showing your allocation of STRK, along with the start and end dates within which you can claim your allocation.

         ![](/assets/6_allocation_starknet.png)
      2. Click **Claim your tokens**. A welcome screen appears, customized according to your type of eligibility.

         ![](/assets/7a_gm_starkling.png)
      3. Click **Next**, and the next two screens prompt you to answer a couple of optional questions to help you get familiar with Starknet. You can answer each question and click **Submit answer** to quiz yourself, or you can click **Skip** to move forward to **Voting and delegation**.

      4. On the **Voting and delegation** screen, you can delegate the voting power that your STRK gives you. This step is not mandatory in order to claim your STRK, but the transaction is subsidized if you do it now, as part of the claim process.\
         For information on voting, delegation, and Starknet Governance, see [the Starknet Governance Hub](https://governance.starknet.io/learn/vstrk_overview). (Don’t worry, if you take some time to read about Governance now, you can always come back later to claim your STRK.)

         ![](/assets/9_voting_and_delegation.png)

         You can click **Skip** and use the Starknet Governance Hub to delegate your votes at another time, however, the transaction fees for delegating will not be subsidized.
      5. After you click one of the Delegate buttons, the **Delegate votes** dialog opens.

         ![](/assets/9.1_delegate_votes.png)

         Set the amount of STRK that you want to use for voting.

         **NOTE**: vSTRK is Starknet’s voting token. You need to designate the amount of STRK you want to use for voting by wrapping that amount STRK to vSTRK.

         See the exact amount of vSTRK you’ll receive under **Voting power received**. Click the **Delegate** button, and approve the transaction in your wallet when prompted.
      6. After the delegation transaction completes, the **Claim your tokens** screen shows how much STRK and vSTRK you are now eligible to claim. Notice that the amount of vSTRK you are eligible to claim is the amount of STRK you chose to delegate. If you change your mind about the number of tokens you want to delegate, you can click back, or if you decide that you don’t want to delegate any, you can click **Delete delegation**.

         ![](/assets/10_claim_your_tokens.png)

         Here’s what you see if you don’t delegate any STRK:

         ![](/assets/10.1_claim_tokens_no_delegation.png)
      7. When you’re satisfied with your delegation choice, click the **Complete claiming tokens** button.

            If you’re connected with an Ethereum wallet, you need to approve the transaction.\
         After the final screen appears saying that your tokens are on the way, you should see them appear in your wallet. You can click **Disconnect** at any time.

      ![](/assets/11_strk_on_the_way.png)

         That’s it! Soon, you should see your STRK and vSTRK in your Starknet wallet. The exact amount of time it takes depends on several factors, so don’t worry if you don’t see them immediately.

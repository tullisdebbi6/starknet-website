type: conference
name: DeFi Security Summit
description: DeFi Security Summit (DSS) is a unique, marketing-free annual event
  for education and technical advances in securing decentralized applications on
  top of blockchain technology. The forum brings together hackers, protocol
  builders, and tool providers who are interested in technologies and
  disciplines to make blockchain applications safer, both off-chain and on-chain
  components. The summit is inspired by security meetings like CCC and Defcon,
  which focus on security researchers, bringing together security providers and
  consumers. DSS 2024 is our third annual conference following two successful
  events in 2022 and 2023.

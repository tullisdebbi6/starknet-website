name: Starknet Workshop @ EPFL
description: "Join us on May 16th for an exciting workshop on Starknet at EPFL.
  We will be joined by Roberk from the Starknet Foundation. He will be hosting a
  workshop about Starknet and Cairo.  ​It will be structured in two different
  parts:  ​In the first part, we will focus on what Starknet is and how to get
  started with Cairo, installing the necessary dependencies, learning about its
  syntax, and solving interactive exercises.  ​In the second part, we will focus
  on building a smart contract. This will cover the anatomy of a Starknet Smart
  Contract and key concepts such as the constructor function, contract storage,
  exposing functions, components, and more! Additionally, we will cover
  cross-contract interaction and the utilization of external dependencies such
  as OpenZeppelin. Finally, we will deploy it on Testnet with Starknet
  Foundry!  ​Pizzas and drinks will be distributed at the end of the event if
  you're registered!"

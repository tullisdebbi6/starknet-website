name: Eth Prague
description: ETHPrague isn't looking for the next get rich quick scheme or
  groundbreaking DeFi apps. Instead, it's an event focused on the future of
  Ethereum and potential concepts or applications that don't yet exist.  We want
  to tackle challenges that could arise in the next decade because we believe
  Ethereum will play a major role in solving economic, social, and environmental
  problems. The future is in your hands, anon! You decide whether we end up
  living in a dark, authoritarian dystopia or a bright, solarpunk utopia.

      ## 6﻿.       Risk


      By accessing and using the Services, you represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets. You further understand that the markets for digital assets are highly volatile due to various factors, including adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the protocol through the interface, you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes, experience significant price slippage and cost.


      You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the service. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Services.


      Without limiting the foregoing, you also understand that there may be tax and regulatory risks related to using the service. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct in connection with your use of the service, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services are also subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty.  You also understand that legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability, transactability and accessibility of digital assets, bridging, the protocol, or other parts of the service.


      You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any risks associated with your use of the Services, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Services.


      ## 7.        Intellectual Property Rights


      You acknowledge and agree that the Service may contain content or features (“**Service Content**”) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by Starknet Foundation, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services or the Service Content, in whole or in party.

All goodwill generated from the use of Starknet Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.

You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms of Use.


      ## 11.    Disclaimer of Warranties


      This Website and the Services are offered "as is" and "as available", and the Starknet Foundation makes no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, regarding the Website, the Services or their use.

      ## 12.    Limitation of Liability


      You acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Starknet Foundation, any of our affiliates, nor any of the officers, directors and employees of the Company or our affiliates,  be liable for any claim, damages or any other form of liability, whether in action or in tort, arising from or in connection with your use or inability to use the Website, or any website linked to this Website, or any content provided on the Website or those other websites.


      You accept and acknowledge that there are risks associated with participating in the Services including, but not limited to, the risk of failure of hardware, software and internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, loss of rewards, and security risks.  You accept and acknowledge that the Starknet Foundation will not be responsible for any losses, failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when participating in the Services, however caused.  The Starknet Foundation will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and takes no responsibility for and will not be liable to you for your participation in the Services.

      Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty disclaimers or limitations on liability. Only disclaimers or limitations that are lawful in the applicable jurisdiction will apply to you and our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.


      ## 13.    Indemnification and Release


      You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Starknet Foundation, its affiliates, and its and their respective officers, employees, directors, service providers, licensors, and agents (collectively, the “Starknet Parties”) from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind, and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of Use, or your violation of any rights of another. Starknet Foundation will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Starknet Foundation reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Starknet Foundation’ defence of such matter. You may not settle or compromise any claim against the Starknet Foundation Parties without Starknet Foundation’ prior written consent.


      You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Service. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Service, including your interaction with the Protocol


      ## 14.    Governing Law


      These Terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without reference to its conflict of law provisions, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such laws.


      ## 15.    Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration


      This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Use as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Starknet Foundation, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.


      ### A     Waivers


      Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution and replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  Your acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).


      You and Starknet Foundation agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Starknet Foundation agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s), except that you may pursue a claim for and the arbitrator may award public injunctive relief under applicable law to the extent required for the enforceability of this provision.


      ### B     Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution


      Starknet Foundation is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing user support at provisionsupport@starknet.org.


      If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”). The Notice to Starknet Foundation should be sent to provisionsupport@starknet.org (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.


      If Starknet Foundation and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Starknet Foundation may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Starknet Foundation or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Starknet Foundation is entitled.


      ### C     Arbitration Procedures


      Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the London Court of International Arbitration (“**LCIA**”) rules and procedures. For information on the LCIA, please visit its website, https://www.lcia.org. Information about the LCIA Rules can be found at https://www.lcia.org/ Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2020.aspx.


      If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would.


      All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.


      Unless Starknet Foundation and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by LCIA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Starknet Foundation agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the LCIA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the LCIA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.


      ### D     Costs of Arbitration


      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “**Arbitration Fees**”) will be governed by the LCIA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.


      ### E      Confidentiality


      All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.


      ### F      Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement


      Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, Starknet Foundation agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Starknet Foundation written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).


      ## 16.    Assignment


      You may not sell, assign, novate or otherwise transfer any of your rights, duties or obligations under the Terms without the Company's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. The Starknet Foundation reserves the right to assign or transfer the Terms or any of its rights, duties and obligations hereunder to any third party. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.


      ## 17.    Severability


      If any term, clause, or provision of the Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable (in whole or in part), then such term, clause, or provision shall be severable from the Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision in the Terms, which will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable provisions will be interpreted to affect the intent of the original provisions. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be severed from the Terms, but the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.


      ## 18.    Contact


      If you have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact us for any reason, you can reach us at: provisionsupport@starknet.org.

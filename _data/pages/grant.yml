              up to $25,000 in USDC in non-dilutive funding to enhance the
              growth of the Starknet ecosystem. 


              This program has a simplified application and evaluation process, aiming to provide a decision approximately two weeks after submission. 


              A Seed Grant is appropriate for projects and teams that meet any of the following criteria:


              * Actively involved in the Starknet community and/ or participated in a Starknet hackathon, builder program, or other entry-level initiative.

              * Already developed an MVP or proof of concept.

              * Willing to submit a demo or links to a proof of concept or MVP.

              * Planning on using or building upon existing Starknet tools and integrations.

              * You’re experimenting with innovative concepts aimed at pushing boundaries of what is possible on Starknet.


              All teams should present a clear plan detailing how the grant will be used within the next three months.


              We welcome applications from all industries, and there are no restrictions on the types of projects we consider.

              The Seed Grant Program is designed to provide teams with grants up
              to $25,000 in USDC in non-dilutive funding to enhance the growth
              of the Starknet ecosystem. 


              This program has a simplified application and evaluation process, aiming to provide a decision approximately two weeks after submission. 


              Seed Grants  are  intended for projects that have already developed a minimum viable product (MVP) or proof of concept, but haven’t yet gone to market. They are appropriate for projects and teams that meet the following criteria:


              * actively involved in the Starknet community and / or participated in a Starknet hackathon, builder program, or other entry-level initiative;

              * developed an MVP or proof of concept; and

              * planning on using or building upon existing Starknet tools and integrations.


              **All teams should present a clear plan detailing how the grant will be used within the next three months.**


              We welcome applications from all industries, and there are no restrictions on the types of products we consider.
